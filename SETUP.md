## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 🎨 Design System

The website uses a consistent design system defined in `src/index.css`:

### Colors
- **Primary (Teal):** `hsl(174 85% 38%)` - Main brand color
- **Accent (Gold):** `hsl(36 40% 60%)` - Luxury accent
- **Background:** Clean white with soft gradients
- **Muted:** `hsl(174 20% 96%)` - Subtle backgrounds

### Typography
- **Headings:** Playfair Display (elegant serif)
- **Body:** Poppins (clean sans-serif)

### Gradients
- `gradient-hero` - Teal gradient for CTAs
- `gradient-accent` - Gold gradient for special elements
- `gradient-soft` - Subtle background gradient

## 📝 Important Notes

### Logo
**IMPORTANT:** I noticed you mentioned attaching a logo image, but I couldn't access it. The website currently displays "SHARMORIA" as text in the header. To add your logo:

1. Save your logo as `public/logo.png`
2. Update the Header component (`src/components/Header.tsx`) to use:
   ```tsx
   <img src="/logo.png" alt="SHARMORIA" className="h-12 md:h-14" />
   ```

### Booking System
The booking form currently saves data to localStorage for testing. For production:
- Consider integrating with a backend API
- Add email notifications
- Implement payment processing
- Set up a proper database

### Images
All service images have been generated using AI and are located in `src/assets/`. These are high-quality, royalty-free images perfect for your spa business.

### Contact Information
Update the following in multiple files:
- Phone: Currently set to `+27 83 123 4567`
- WhatsApp: Currently set to `27831234567`
- Email: Add your business email
- Service areas: Currently Johannesburg & Pretoria

Files to update:
- `src/components/Footer.tsx`
- `src/pages/Contact.tsx`
- `src/pages/Home.tsx`
